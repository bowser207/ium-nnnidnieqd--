              <h2>What is iTunes?</h2>
              <p>iTunes was a media player and library application developed by Apple Inc. It was first released in January 2001 and was primarily used to organize and play digital music and video files on personal computers running the macOS and Windows operating systems.

                iTunes also served as a hub for the iTunes Store, where users could purchase and download music, movies, TV shows, and other digital media content. Additionally, iTunes had features for syncing media files with Apple's iPod, iPhone, and iPad devices.
                
                In later years, Apple began to phase out iTunes and replaced it with separate apps for music, TV, and podcasts on macOS, while on Windows, users can access these features via the Apple Music app.</p>
